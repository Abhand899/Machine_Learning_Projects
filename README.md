# Machine_Learning_Projects

In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

  i) k-Nearest Neighbour
 ii) Decision Tree
iii) Support Vector Machine
 iv) Logistic Regression
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

 a) Jaccard index
 b) F1-score
 c) LogLoss
